            Here's everything you always wanted to know about running shoes, but
            were afraid to ask: What is the best running shoe? There is only the
            best running shoe for you. Because each runner is unique in how much
            they train, and what their running style, there is no "perfect"
            running shoe. The best running shoe for you depends entirely on the
            shape of your foot, your bio-mechanics and on the amount of running
            you do. Running shoes are designed to protect your feet from the
            road, provided traction on different surfaces, cushion the landing
            shock and support your feet. Not too much to ask, or is it? Key
            points on picking the right running shoe: If you experiment,you're
            not alone. Picking the right shoes for running is more of an art
            than a science. Many runners experiment with different brands and
            models until they find just the right fit, feel and functionality.
            To shorten your trial and error path follow these steps: Buy shoes
            designed for running: Running shoes are designed to handle the shock
            of 2.5 times your body weight that is created by the impact each
            time your foot strikes the ground. When you're running, you want to
            have excellent cushioning in both the heel and forefoot to handle
            this impact. If you plan on running three times a week or more, move
            up to a real running shoe. Why buy a real running shoe? Because you
            want to LOOK FAST of course. OK, really, running shoes provide the
            best protection for your feet, legs and body from the repeated
            stress of thousands of foot landings per mile. Each time you take a
            stride and land, your foot has to absorb two to three times your
            body weight. This repeated impact is different from other sports.
            Running shoes have built-in features that enable you to run day
            after day more comfortably and with less chance of over-use injury.
            Here are some of the advantages of running shoes: Superior
            Cushioning Flexibility in the right places Stability or Motion
            control Traction on road or trails Tortional stability â€“ stiff where
            needed Night-time reflectivity Breathability Feet first: Before you
            buy Even before you step inside a store, you need to know what type
            of foot you have. Yeah, it's a stinky job, but somebody's gotta look
            at your feet.
